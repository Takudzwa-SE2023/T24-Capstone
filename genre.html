    <h1>But what about it?</h1>

    <p>
        Gaming is popular. There are many types of games and all of them are in different genres.
        Just like music, the genres are there to allow everyone to find what they may enjoy.
        Some people enjoy games that dont need much thinking, others enjoy RPG (Role playing games),
        and others enjoy animated games. As we can see there are many kinds of games and forms of gaming
        But for now we will focus on the gaming genres.The below are some of the Genres i enjoy and still do.
    </p>

    <h2>Animated Gaming</h2>
    <p>
        Animated gaming has gotten quiet popular especially since a lot more people are enjoying Anime,
        cartoons and animated shows like The simpsons or Rick and Morty. see the website <a href="https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?title_type=video_game&genres=animation&explore=genres">here</a>
        for more animated games.
    </p>

    <h2>Role Play Gaming</h2>
    <p>
        These games are more difficult, but then again they do come with the option to change your difficulty level.
        These games have to do with a lot more fantasy role playing.Depending on the game one can even create a 
        character. These games allow one to be able to do nearly everything (except that wich is prohibited based on the game.)
        They include the following games: The witch Hunter, Mass Effect, God of war and The Last of us, to see more  click <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/library/rpg">here</a>
    </p>

    <h2>Multiplayer Online Battle Arena</h2>

    <p>These are epic. Simply because its more than just you playing alone. Its very competitive and its about who has the best strategy,
        Who has been playing for longer, who knows the tips and tricks too. There are diffrent levels and these totally depend on the game 
        and how many wins you have or how long you have been playing. To put it in simple words, the better you are the harder the game.
        These multiplayer games are just made this way, but other gaming creators have made ways to make the game more user friendly "easy"
        for other people. Take for example fortnite. This game has features such as: 0 build ( No building, building is a more advanced way 
        of protecting yourself in the game, but some people do not enjoy building, and as a result, game creators made 0 build and build game modes)
