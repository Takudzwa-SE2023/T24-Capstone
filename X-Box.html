     <h1>Xbox </h1>

     <p>My brothers and i once owned an Xbox 360. To be honest we njoyed having it because
        it was the first gaming Counsel that we were given, although it was second hand,
        it still functioned really well.
     </p>

     <h2>So why move away from Xbox</h2>
     <p>
        What really sucked was that we couldnt play a single game (FULL GAME) as they were all demos.
        Most of my friends ownwed playstatsions, and although it took a good 10 years 
        before we got a ps4, the Xbox started to fail, it was old and was not running
        the same way as previous years.
        This obviously led to us wanting Playstation a lot more. Now we have it and 
        we are more that content........... even though the playstation 5 is pricey,
        we still want to purhase it soon.
     </p>

     <p>This though does not mean Xbox is inferiour or sucks. They have many games that playstation
        does not have. Have a look at the table below showing th image and the release date of each Xbox
