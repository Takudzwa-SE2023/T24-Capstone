        <h1>WHY GAMING?</h1>


        <p>
            Well why not GAMING? Gaming is the one thing in my opinion where you can 
            potentially be whatever you want. We are talking from being a hero to a 
            villan or a certain character. It is  more than that though, to me gaming 
            is soothing and over the years i have come to acknowlege not only the game 
            but the game creators. From playing games because they are fun/entertaining,
            to playing them and overthinkg as to how they coded certain parts of the game.
            This doesnt stop me from enjoying the game, but i belive allows me to enjoy gaming more.
